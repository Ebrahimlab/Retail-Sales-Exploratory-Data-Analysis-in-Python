# Retail-Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-Python

This project analyzes a fictional but realistic retail sales dataset to uncover customer purchasing patterns, category preferences, and seasonal spending trends.
The dataset includes:
**Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount**

Although the data is synthetic, the analysis methods and insights are directly applicable to real-world retail data, helping businesses optimize marketing, inventory, and customer engagement strategies.

**Business Questions Addressed**
1. **Customer Demographics & Spending** — How does age and gender influence total purchase amounts?
2. **Product Category Preferences** — Which category is most purchased by each age-gender group?
3. **Time-Based Spending Trends** — How do sales vary by day and month across product categories, customer counts, and gender?
