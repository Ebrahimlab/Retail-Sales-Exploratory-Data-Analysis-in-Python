# Retail-Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-Python

This project analyzes a fictional but realistic retail sales dataset to uncover customer purchasing patterns, category preferences, and seasonal spending trends.
The dataset includes:
# Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount

Although the data is synthetic, the analysis methods and insights are directly applicable to real-world retail data, helping businesses optimize marketing, inventory, and customer engagement strategies.
